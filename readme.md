## Case Study

As part of the Galvanize Data Science Immersive, my partner Lee and I were tasked to create a model 
to either maximize profits or minimize costs by predicting churn rates for a rideshare service 
in San Francisco. Churn rates are simply the rate at which customers leave the company. 

In the Churn jupyter notebook, we carried out our modeling and exploratory data analysis, and
applied a number of models, including Gradient Boosting and Random Forests to optimize 
our cost and benefits. We focused on minimizing costs, and thus chose to maximize our recall 
score-- the chance that our model correctly predicted a churn, given that the customer had
actually churned. This allowed us to make a businesss case for how to differentiate the company's 
marketing plan in order to best deploy limited resources.
