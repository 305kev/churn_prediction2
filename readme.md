## Case Study

Today we are going to review all the machine learning algorithms
we have learnt in the past two weeks. To make things more
interesting, this afternoon we will work in groups to
tackle a real problem in the industry. The problem is churn
prediction with a ride-sharing company in San Francisco. Since the
data is sourced from a real company, we would ask you not to share
the dataset. See more about the problem in [group.md](group.md).
